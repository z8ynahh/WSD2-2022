## Project Management

**Each group should manage the web development process as a team.**

- We suggest that each group has an internal discussion in the first week about your different skills and interests as part of an ice-breaker. You could identify who likes managing, writing, coding and designing.

- There is no need to appoint an official 'project manager' but you should make sure that you have a process for coordinating these tasks.

- Be clear with each other what your strengths are, but at the same time allow people to develop their skills – enthusiasm and curiosity are important aspects of this assignment.

- Set frequent deadlines for all of the various elements of the project when relevant.

- Support each other by meeting each deadline with your personal contribution.

- Please meet at least twice a week in your groups (excluding class time) to coordinate your roles and activities. 

- Think about what needs to be done synchronously or asynchronously.

- Set up and agree communications channels. This will be based around MS Teams, but you may want to support this using oter channels.

## Guidelines for good Group Working

1. Everyone in the group should ensure that they can be contacted easily by other members of the group by giving them adequate contact information.

2. When working in a group, please treat other members of the group with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if you do not necessarily agree with them. Create an atmosphere where you all feel you can check and contribute to documents before submission.

3. You are expected to make a full and fair contribution to the work of the group.

4. When you agree to undertake a task that has been assigned to you by the group you must try work to the agreed deadline since failure to do so could impede the progress of the whole project.

5. You have the right, naturally, to challenge other’s opinions but please try to do it in a professional way.

6. It is your responsibility to attend all meetings arranged by the group to advance the project, and to arrive at those meetings on time. If you can’t attend a meeting of the group you should consider providing your input in written form and giving this to the other group members before the meeting.

7. If another member of your group tells you something in confidence, you should respect their wishes.
